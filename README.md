## Hi there 👋

I'n Angad, an aspiring game developer and software developer.

I outline and develop full-stack project and game ideas that I find interest in

My tech stack consists of react, tailwind, typscript, sql, though I have much experience in tools like unity and version control systems

My newest project is [FilmRate](https://github.com/pesky-t6/FilmRate), where users can leave reviews on their favourite films and shows
